# üêü Case Study #6 - Clique Bait

## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Solution - B. Product Funnel Analysis

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

1. How many times was each product viewed?
2. How many times was each product added to cart?
3. How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
4. How many times was each product purchased?

## Planning Our Strategy

Let us visualize the output table.

| Column | Description | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| product | Name of the product |
| views | Number of views for each product |
| cart_adds | Number of cart adds for each product |
| abandoned | Number of times product was added to a cart, but not purchased |
| purchased | Number of times product was purchased |

These information would come from these 2 tables.
- `events` table - visit_id, page_id, event_type
- `page_hierarchy` table - page_id, product_category

**Solution**

- Note 1 - In `product_page_events` CTE, find page views and cart adds for individual visit ids by wrapping `SUM` around `CASE statements` so that we do not have to group the results by `event_type` as well.
- Note 2 - In `purchase_events` CTE, get only visit ids that have made purchases.
- Note 3 - In `combined_table` CTE, merge `product_page_events` and `purchase_events` using `LEFT JOIN`. Take note of the table sequence. In order to filter for visit ids with purchases, we use a `CASE statement` and where visit id is not null, it means the visit id is a purchase. 

```sql
WITH product_page_events AS ( -- Note 1
  SELECT 
    e.visit_id,
    ph.product_id,
    ph.page_name AS product_name,
    ph.product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_view, -- 1 for Page View
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_add -- 2 for Add Cart
  FROM clique_bait.events AS e
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS ph
    ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
  WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY e.visit_id, ph.product_id, ph.page_name, ph.product_category
),
purchase_events AS ( -- Note 2
  SELECT 
    DISTINCT visit_id
  FROM clique_bait.events
  WHERE event_type = 3 -- 3 for Purchase
),
combined_table AS ( -- Note 3
  SELECT 
    ppe.visit_id, 
    ppe.product_id, 
    ppe.product_name, 
    ppe.product_category, 
    ppe.page_view, 
    ppe.cart_add,
    CASE WHEN pe.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS purchase
  FROM product_page_events AS ppe
  LEFT JOIN purchase_events AS pe
    ON ppe.visit_id = pe.visit_id
),
product_info AS (
  SELECT 
    product_name, 
    product_category, 
    SUM(page_view) AS views,
    SUM(cart_add) AS cart_adds, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abandoned,
    SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases
  FROM combined_table
  GROUP BY product_id, product_name, product_category)

SELECT *
FROM product_info
ORDER BY product_id;
```

The logic behind `abandoned` column in which `cart_add = 1` where a customer adds an item into the cart, but `purchase = 0` customer did not purchase and abandoned the cart.

Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

**Solution**

```sql
WITH product_page_events AS ( -- Note 1
  SELECT 
    e.visit_id,
    ph.product_id,
    ph.page_name AS product_name,
    ph.product_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_view, -- 1 for Page View
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_add -- 2 for Add Cart
  FROM clique_bait.events AS e
  JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy AS ph
    ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
  WHERE product_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY e.visit_id, ph.product_id, ph.page_name, ph.product_category
),
purchase_events AS ( -- Note 2
  SELECT 
    DISTINCT visit_id
  FROM clique_bait.events
  WHERE event_type = 3 -- 3 for Purchase
),
combined_table AS ( -- Note 3
  SELECT 
    ppe.visit_id, 
    ppe.product_id, 
    ppe.product_name, 
    ppe.product_category, 
    ppe.page_view, 
    ppe.cart_add,
    CASE WHEN pe.visit_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS purchase
  FROM product_page_events AS ppe
  LEFT JOIN purchase_events AS pe
    ON ppe.visit_id = pe.visit_id
),
product_category AS (
  SELECT 
    product_category, 
    SUM(page_view) AS views,
    SUM(cart_add) AS cart_adds, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS abandoned,
    SUM(CASE WHEN cart_add = 1 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchases
  FROM combined_table
  GROUP BY product_category)

SELECT *
FROM product_category
```

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

**1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?**

**2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?**

<kbd><img width="820" alt="Screenshot 2021-10-09 at 4 18 13 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/136650364-0f44ac58-8be7-4f4e-89a7-2598a24af5ce.png"></kbd>

- Oyster has the most views.
- Lobster has the most cart adds and purchases.
- Russian Caviar is most likely to be abandoned.

**3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?**

```sql
SELECT 
    product_name, 
  product_category, 
  ROUND(100 * purchases/views,2) AS purchase_per_view_percentage
FROM product_info
ORDER BY purchase_per_view_percentage DESC
```

- Lobster has the highest view to purchase percentage at 48.74%.

**4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?**

**5. What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?**

```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(100*AVG(cart_adds/views),2) AS avg_view_to_cart_add_conversion,
  ROUND(100*AVG(purchases/cart_adds),2) AS avg_cart_add_to_purchases_conversion_rate
FROM product_info
```

- Average views to cart adds rate is 60.95% and average cart adds to purchases rate is 75.93%.
- Although the cart add rate is lower, but the conversion of potential customer to the sales funnel is at least 15% higher.
