# üçÖ Case Study #8 - Fresh Segments

## üßº Solution - A. Data Exploration and Cleansing

### 1. Update the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table by modifying the `month_year` column to be a `date` data type with the start of the month

```sql
ALTER TABLE fresh_segments.interest_metrics
ALTER month_year TYPE DATE USING month_year::DATE;
```

### 2. What is count of records in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` for each `month_year` value sorted in chronological order (earliest to latest) with the `null` values appearing first?

```sql
SELECT 
  month_year, COUNT(*)
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
GROUP BY month_year
ORDER BY month_year NULLS FIRST;
```

### 3. What do you think we should do with these `null` values in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics`?

The `null` values appear in `_month`, `_year`, `month_year`, and `interest_id`. The corresponding values in `composition`, `index_value`, `ranking`, and `percentile_ranking` fields are not meaningful without the specific information on `interest_id` and dates. 

Before dropping the values, it would be useful to find out the percentage of `null` values.

```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(100 * (SUM(CASE WHEN interest_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) * 1.0 /
    COUNT(*)),2) AS null_perc
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
```

<kbd><img width="112" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/138892507-5b89eba8-45c7-4edf-9c05-42347f47c746.png"></kbd>

The percentage of null values is 8.36% which is less than 10%, hence I would suggest to drop all the `null` values.

```sql
DELETE FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
WHERE interest_id IS NULL;

-- Run again to confirm that there are no null values.
SELECT 
  ROUND(100 * (SUM(CASE WHEN interest_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) * 1.0 /
    COUNT(*)),2) AS null_perc
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
```

<kbd><img width="120" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/138899920-52b8249c-ba52-4d47-b3b2-6d7c76558007.png"></kbd>

Confirmed that there are no `null` values in `fresh_segments.interest_metrics`.

### 4. How many `interest_id` values exist in the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table but not in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? What about the other way around?

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT map.id) AS map_id_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT metrics.interest_id) AS metrics_id_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN map.id is NULL THEN 1 END) AS not_in_metric,
  SUM(CASE WHEN metrics.interest_id is NULL THEN 1 END) AS not_in_map
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map map
FULL OUTER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_metrics metrics
  ON metrics.interest_id = map.id;
```

<kbd><img width="617" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/138908809-72bef6fa-825e-40e5-a326-43e9bc56f24d.png"></kbd>

- There are 1,209 unique `id`s in `interest_map`.
- There are 1,202 unique `interest_id`s in `interest_metrics`.
- There are no `interest_id` that did not appear in `interest_map`. All 1,202 ids were present in the `interest_metrics` table.
- There are 7 `id`s that did not appear in `interest_metrics`. 

### 5. Summarise the id values in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` by its total record count in this table

I found the solution for this question to be strange - hence I came up with another summary of the id values too.

Original solution:

```sql 
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map
```

My solution:

```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  interest_name, 
  COUNT(*)
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map map
JOIN fresh_segments.interest_metrics metrics
  ON map.id = metrics.interest_id
GROUP BY id, interest_name
ORDER BY count DESC, id;
```

### 6. What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where 'interest_id = 21246' in your joined output and include all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` and all columns from `fresh_segments.interest_map` except from the id column.

We should be using `INNER JOIN` to perform our analysis.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map map
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_metrics metrics
  ON map.id = metrics.interest_id
WHERE metrics.interest_id = 21246   
  AND metrics._month IS NOT NULL; -- There were instances when interest_id is available, however the date values were not - hence filter them out.
```

<kbd><img width="979" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139016366-b6031eb7-3db9-4e1e-89a9-66136522fd4e.png"></kbd>

The results should come up to 10 rows only. 

### 7. Are there any records in your joined table where the `month_year` value is before the `created_at` value from the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table? Do you think these values are valid and why?

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*)
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map map
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_metrics metrics
  ON map.id = metrics.interest_id
WHERE metrics.month_year < map.created_at::DATE;
```

<kbd><img width="106" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139017976-48aade91-969c-432f-83b3-a14436f66056.png"></kbd>

There are 188 records where the `month_year` date is before the `created_at` date. 

However, it looks like these records are created in the same month as `month_year`. Do you remember that the `month_year` column's date is set to default on 1st day of the month? 

<kbd><img width="761" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139018053-f948b63a-d502-4337-b347-8c24f736f32f.png"></kbd>

Running another test to see whether date in `month_year` and `created_at` are in the same month.

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*)
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map map
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_metrics metrics
  ON map.id = metrics.interest_id
WHERE metrics.month_year < DATE_TRUNC('mon', map.created_at::DATE);
```

<kbd><img width="110" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81607668/139018367-ab5b5148-a2e1-4b53-968e-eedb7eb717a3.png"></kbd>

Seems like all the records' dates are in the same month, hence we will consider the records as valid.
